The Future Is... What We Make It
The Future Is... What We Make It
Honeywell Chairman and CEO Darius Adamczyk has an in-depth conversation about the past, present and future of the company.
September 8, 2020
The secret to staying in business for more than a century is being able to pivot quickly, said our CEO and Chairman Darius Adamczyk.
"You need to continue to reinvent yourself," Darius said. "Pursue things that maybe are outside of your comfort zone. Anticipate where the world's going to be 10, 20, 30 years from now."
And what will that world look like? We'll travel in air taxis and solve problems with quantum computers.
Darius goes behind the scenes of how Honeywell is planning for  that world.
He also marks 100 years of innovation and talks about how he lead Honeywell during the COVID-19 crisis.
