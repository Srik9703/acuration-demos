MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., Nov. 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced the determination of the pricing terms of its previously announced four separate private offers to exchange any and all of its outstanding notes listed below (the "Existing Notes") for a combination of newly issued debt securities of Honeywell and cash (the "Exchange Offers"). The Exchange Offers are being conducted subject to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offering Memorandum dated October 23, 2017 and the accompanying eligibility letter (the "Exchange Offer Documents").
The pricing terms were determined as of 2:00 p.m., New York City time, today, November 3, 2017 (the "Price Determination Time") in accordance with the terms of the Exchange Offer Documents.
On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Exchange Offer Documents, Eligible Holders (as defined below) who validly tender Existing Notes at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, today, November 3, 2017, (the "Early Participation Deadline"), and do not validly withdraw such tendered Existing Notes at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, today, November 3, 2017, (the "Withdrawal Deadline"), will receive, on the Settlement Date, for each $1,000 principal amount of Existing Notes tendered and accepted, a combination of a principal amount of New Notes and cash with an aggregate value equal to the Total Exchange Price as set forth in the table below and determined in accordance with the Offering Memorandum.

The New Notes will mature on November 21, 2047 and will accrue interest from the Settlement Date at a rate per annum of 3.812%.
On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Exchange Offer Documents, Eligible Holders who validly tender Existing Notes after the Early Participation Deadline, but at or prior to the Expiration Time, will receive, on the Settlement Date, for each $1,000 principal amount of Existing Notes tendered and accepted, a combination of a principal amount of New Notes and cash with an aggregate value equal to the Total Exchange Price less the Early Participation Premium (the "Exchange Price").
In addition to the Total Exchange Price or Exchange Price, as applicable, Eligible Holders whose Existing Notes are accepted for exchange will receive a cash payment representing (i) the accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Settlement Date, and (ii) amounts due in lieu of any fractional amounts of New Notes.
The Exchange Offers will each expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on November 17, 2017 (as the same may be extended with respect to each Exchange Offer, the "Expiration Time"). Honeywell's obligation to accept any series of Existing Notes tendered in the Exchange Offers is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions applicable to the Exchange Offer for such series, as well as the Minimum Issue Requirement, as described in the Offering Memorandum and Honeywell's launch press release dated October 23, 2017.
Only holders who have duly completed and submitted an eligibility letter (which may be found at https://gbsc-usa.com/eligibility/honeywell) will be authorized to receive the Offering Memorandum and participate in the Exchange Offers ("Eligible Holders"). The eligibility letters will include certifications that the holders are either (1) "qualified institutional buyers" ("QIBs") as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or (2) non-"U.S. persons" (as defined in Rule 902 under the Securities Act) located outside of the United States who are (i) not acting for the account or benefit of a U.S. person, (ii) "non-U.S. qualified offerees" (as defined in the Exchange Offer Documents), and (iii) not resident in Canada.
If and when issued, the New Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. Therefore, the New Notes may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws. Honeywell will enter into a registration rights agreement with respect to the New Notes.
Global Bondholder Services Corporation is acting as the Information Agent and the Exchange Agent for the Exchange Offers. Questions or requests for assistance related to the Exchange Offers or for additional copies of the Exchange Offer Documents may be directed to Global Bondholder Services Corporation at (866) 470-3800 (toll free) or (212) 430-3774 (collect). You may also contact your broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee for assistance concerning the Exchange Offers.
If Honeywell terminates any Exchange Offer with respect to one or more series of Existing Notes, it will give prompt notice to the Exchange Agent and all Existing Notes tendered pursuant to such terminated Exchange Offer will be returned promptly to the tendering holders thereof. With effect from such termination, any Existing Notes blocked in DTC will be released.
Eligible Holders are advised to check with any bank, securities broker or other intermediary through which they hold Existing Notes as to when such intermediary needs to receive instructions from a holder in order for that holder to be able to participate in, or (in the circumstances in which revocation is permitted) revoke their instruction to participate in, the Exchange Offers before the deadlines specified herein and in the Exchange Offer Documents. The deadlines set by each clearing system for the submission and withdrawal of exchange instructions will also be earlier than the relevant deadlines specified herein and in the Exchange Offer Documents.
This announcement is for informational purposes only. This announcement is not an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to purchase any Existing Notes. The Exchange Offers are being made solely pursuant to the Offering Memorandum and related documents. The Exchange Offers are not being made to holders of Existing Notes in any jurisdiction in which the making or acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the securities, blue sky or other laws of such jurisdiction. In any jurisdiction in which the securities laws or blue sky laws require the Exchange Offers to be made by a licensed broker or dealer, the Offers will be deemed to be made on behalf of Honeywell by the dealer managers or one or more registered brokers or dealers that are licensed under the laws of such jurisdiction.
