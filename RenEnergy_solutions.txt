	What are the alternative sources of energy?
		Alternative Energy Use - National Geographic Education
		Alternative energy here includes hydroelectric energy, solar energy, geothermal energy, wind energy, nuclear energy, and biomass energy. The data come from the World Bank.
		 Alternative energy is energy that does not come from fossil fuels and produces little to no greenhouse gases.
	 It is an alternative to coal, oil, and natural gas, which emit high levels of CO2 when burned to produce energy and electricity. (Solar power is both renewable and alternative, but not renewable.)
	 The map shows the average percentage of a country's total energy use that came from alternative sources between 20062010, including hydroelectric, solar, geothermal, wind, nuclear, and biomass energy. (Not all energy policy experts agree on how to categorize nuclear energy as an alternative energy source).
	 In 2010, Iceland used the equivalent of 16,842 kilograms of oil per person, but most of its energy came from hydroelectric and geothermal sources. The highest per capita energy consumption of any country in the world, Iceland, is 85% from alternative energy sources.

		 Renewable energy is energy production that uses nonfinite resources
	 Sunlight and wind are essentially inexhaustible sources of energy
	 Benefits of renewable energy include more plentiful and less greenhouse gases and pollutants
	 Most inhabited places on Earth have access to at least 1 or 2 renewable energy sources
	 Solar energy is widely accessible and creates fewer greenhouse gases than traditional fossil fuels
	 Wind energy is easily accessible and sustainable, and can power entire cities or even entire countries
	 Hydroelectric power is produced by building turbines in moving water and can create artificial channels in waterfalls to generate electricity

	What are the renewable energy options?
		What are the different types of renewable energy? - National Grid
		Renewable energy is energy that comes from a source that won't run out. They are natural and self-replenishing, and usually have a low- or zero-carbon footprint. Examples of renewable energy sources include wind power, solar power, bioenergy (organic matter burned as a fuel) and hydroelectric, including tidal energy.
		 Renewable energy is energy that comes from a source that won't run out and has a lowcarbon footprint
	 Examples of renewable energy sources include wind power, solar power, bioenergy, and hydroelectric
	 Wind power is the largest producer of renewable electricity in the UK and US
	 Solar power generates electricity by capturing sunlight on solar panels
	 Hydroelectric power is created using the movement of flowing or falling water and is often found at dams or underwater turbines
	 Bioenergy can be generated from organic matter burned as a fuel source and is considered renewable because it can be regrown and absorb CO2 emissions
	 Nonrenewable energy sources like fossil fuels are finite and emit harmful greenhouse gases like CO2 when burned
	 Governments across the world are looking to develop renewables to exclusively power their nations to help reduce carbon emissions and prevent further global warming.

		 Kenya has a highly developed renewable energy sector with major sources such as solar, wind, water, hydro, biomass, biogas, and geothermal.
	 Competition is inevitable in the renewable energy industry, and companies need to stand out through unique selling propositions (USPs).
	 Renewable energy firms with USPs such as financing solutions, technical expertise, procurement, benefits and cost analysis, licenses and track record, and licenses and permits are attractive to potential clients in the commercial and industrial space. 
	 Different firms have different financing models, including Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) where the client incurs zero initial cost and may have a buyout option after a certain number of years. Some firms partner with foreign EPC giants to position themselves as the best in the class and invest in training their engineers to improve work efficiencies. The materials for constructing renewable energy plants are imported, and costs vary depending on the EPC firm's experience and procurement experience. Companies need to be convinced beyond reasonable doubt that investing in renewable energy will have a net benefit outcome.
